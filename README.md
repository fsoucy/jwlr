# jwlr : a social marketplace

# Developed by James Lovejoy (@metalicjames) and Frank Soucy (@fsoucy)

## Product description

jwlr is a social marketplace which enables store owners to create a virtual storefront and socially engage with their customers. They can publish posts (which can include images) and can share their own products. These posts can be liked, shared, or commented on in a user friendly manner. Additionally, all users on jwlr can message each other and interact easily and effectively. Product upload is streamlined to account for all product types and details in the jewelry industry. Upload images for these products, or upload a gallery image to crop for each corresponding product. If a user is interested in a product, that user can buy it and initialize the jwlr deals process -- flexible enough to account for the ways in which jewelry stores do business. Vendors can choose which payment and exchange methods they accept, whether they want to accept cash or paypal, or want to meetup or have an actual store visit. Additionally, our notifications system allows you to be updated when anything occurs in the community.

Update: this is no longer being commercialized and was just made open-source without significant testing. If you find a bug, feel free to contact me at franksoucy9@gmail.com or contribute to the project yourself.
