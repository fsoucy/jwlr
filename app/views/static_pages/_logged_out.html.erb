              Using new technology, iGold.com preserves the traditional way gold dealers do business. Creating an iGold Profile for your business establishes an easy to use virtual storefront. As trends towards online sales continue increasing, we provide sellers with the power to market individual products to prospective buyers who shop online, but purchase in store. Product placement timing is maximized by putting items in front of multiple buyers as soon as the product is uploaded. Space in our online stores is unlimited, thus inventory not able to be displayed on location, can still be shopped by consumers once uploaded to an online iGold store. Best of all, it's FREE!
